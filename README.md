Benford's law, also called the Newcombâ€“Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small.

For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time.

Here i fibonacci series and length of river around the world is to visualize benford law.

## Fibonacci numbers
Here the percentage of occurence of digits from 0 to 9 in the leading significant digits of the 1st
2000 fibonacci numbers is calculated and plotted against the percentage of occurence according to benfords law
